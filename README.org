* Software Made Proprietary by its Copyright Holders

** What?

This is a list of software that was
[[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html][free software]] and is
now proprietary.

When free software becomes proprietary it means that you, as a user of
the software, no longer have all four essential freedoms to:

1. run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
2. study how the program works, and change it.
3. redistribute copies.
4. distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

Additionally, if you are a user of free software that has become
proprietary, you are now in a supplier lock-in and may be facing further
usage restrictions, the risk of viruses / spyware, as well as large fees
to your supplier.

** How?

There are two legal ways that free software can become proprietary:

1. the copyright holders release a new version of the software using a
   license that is not a free software license.
2. the original software license wasn't
   [[https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/][copyleft]], and some entity later
   distributes a modified version of the software under a proprietary
   license.

This list is concerned with the first case.

** How can I help?

Luckily, there are several ways that you can help.

1. Do not assign copyright of your free software contributions to a
   third party until you have read the FSF guide to
   [[http://gnu.org/philosophy/assigning-copyright.html][assigning
   copyright]] and are comfortable with the situation.
2. When you come across a case of free software that has become
   proprietary, send an email to
   [[mailto:sam.halliday@gmail.com][sam.halliday@gmail.com]] to get
   the item added to this list. Also, inform your community of the
   danger they are facing if they continue to use the software.
3. Create a fork of the software from the last point at which it was
   free software. Make all your changes using a copyleft license, so
   that your changes can not be used in a proprietary distribution.
   Trust that developers will prefer your fork, even if the
   proprietary version may have more features in the short term.
